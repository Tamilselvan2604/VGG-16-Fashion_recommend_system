Fashion Image Recommendation System
===================================

This project demonstrates a **Fashion Image Recommendation System** built using **Deep Learning** and **VGG-16** for feature extraction. 
It identifies visually similar fashion items based on image embeddings and cosine similarity, making it ideal for applications 
like e-commerce platforms and personal styling apps.

------------------------------------

Project Overview
----------------

1. Objective:
   - To create a system that recommends similar fashion items by analyzing image features.

2. Features:
   - Uses **VGG-16** pretrained on ImageNet for accurate feature extraction.
   - Applies **cosine similarity** to identify visually similar items.
   - Visualizes recommendations for easy interpretation.

3. Applications:
   - E-commerce websites for personalized product suggestions.
   - Fashion apps for style matching and outfit planning.
   - Tools for designers to analyze trends and inspirations.

------------------------------------

How It Works
------------

1. Dataset Preparation:
   - Organize images into labeled folders for structured processing.
   - Dataset used: [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)

2. Model Architecture:
   - Leverage **VGG-16** to extract embeddings representing each imageâ€™s features.

3. Similarity Computation:
   - Use **cosine similarity** to calculate distances between image embeddings.

4. Recommendation:
   - Input an image, and the system retrieves the top similar items.

5. Visualization:
   - Results are displayed in a side-by-side comparison format.

Technologies Used
-----------------

- Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
- Pretrained Model: VGG-16
- Programming Language: Python
- Visualization: Matplotlib

How to Run
----------

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tamilselvan2604/VGG-16-Fashion_recommend_system.git
   cd VGG-16-Fashion_recommend_system
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook to train the model or perform inference.

------------------------------------

Future Improvements
--------------------

- Expand to include multi-label recommendations (e.g., complementary items).
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
- Integrate with a web-based user interface for real-time recommendations.
